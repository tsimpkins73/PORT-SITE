         <h2>Hi, I'm Travis</h2>
         <p id="AboutMeText-para">I truly enjoy building and creating new things. Whether it’s building Lego creations
            with my children, drawing, painting, or anything else, I love the process of making something new. That
            enjoyment of creation is what led me to a career in graphic design and now to web development.
<br><br>
            I'm a PERN stack developer with 15 years of graphic design experience and a passion for improvement. I am
            competently proficient in a variety of Web Development skills including; HTML5, CSS, JS, jQuery, React,
            Node, & PostgreSQL. Additionally, being the main source for all things IT in the small businesses I’ve
            worked for has given me a dedication to documentation and concise and usable communication. I’m looking
            forward to creating fantastic things with a team of great programmers. </p>

            <p>Web Dev Toolkit is an aggregated resource hub. This app makes it easy for Web Developers to find learning
               and working resources in one location. The resources are grouped together based upon their type;
               Tutorials, Course, Videos, and Utilities. This app allows authorized users to visit a variety of web
               development resources, save favorite resources, and search through resources to find specific content.
               <br><br>
               Web Dev Toolkit client was built using React and vanilla HTML & CSS. It utilizes React-Router and other
               functions to navigate through content choices and manipulation. The custom Web Dev Toolkit API was built
               using Node, PostgreSQL, knex, and Express. It also utilizes chai & Mocha as testing methods.
