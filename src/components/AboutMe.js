       <p id="AboutMeText-para">I truly enjoy building and creating new things. Whether it’s building Lego creations
          with my children, drawing, painting, or anything else, I love the process of making something new. That
          enjoyment of creation is what led me to a career in graphic design and now to web development.
<br></br><br></br>
          I'm a PERN stack developer with 15 years of graphic design experience and a passion for improvement. I am
          competently proficient in a variety of Web Development skills including; HTML5, CSS, JS, jQuery, React,
          Node, & PostgreSQL. Additionally, being the main source for all things IT in the small businesses I’ve
          worked for has given me a dedication to documentation and concise and usable communication. I’m looking
          forward to creating fantastic things with a team of great programmers. </p>
